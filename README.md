# Running the App:

1. Download and install Node.js in your machine. (You must NOT skip installing "npm" which comes bundled with Node.js)
2. Download the zip folder and unzip it; or clone the repository onto your machine.
3. Open a terminal/command prompt window in the "PokeAPI-App-master" folder or cd to the folder.
4. In the terminal write "npm start", this should start the server and open the webApp in your default browser, if webApp is not launched go to this link: http://localhost:3000/
5. Enjoy and your feedbacks are highly appreciated.
